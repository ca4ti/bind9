Notes for BIND 9.19.8
---------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Dynamic updates that add and remove DNSKEY and NSEC3PARAM records no
  longer trigger key rollovers and denial of existence operations. This
  also means that the option :any:`dnssec-secure-to-insecure` has been
  obsoleted. :gl:`#3686`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A ``configure`` option ``--with-tuning`` has been removed.  The compile-time
  settings that required different values based on "workload" have been either
  removed or a sensible default has been picked.  :gl:`#3664`

- The option :any:`auto-dnssec` is deprecated and will be removed in 9.19.
  Please migrate to :any:`dnssec-policy`. :gl:`#3667`

- Deprecate setting the operating system limit (``coresize``, ``datasize``,
  ``files`` and ``stacksize``) from ``named.conf``.  These options should be set
  from the operating system (``ulimit``) or from the process supervisor
  (e.g. ``systemd``). :gl:`#3676`

- Deprecate setting alternate local addresses for inbound zone transfers
  (:any:`alt-transfer-source`, :any:`alt-transfer-source-v6`,
  :any:`use-alt-transfer-source`). :gl:`#3694`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Increase the number of HTTP headers in the statistics channel from
  10 to 100 to accomodate for some browsers that send more that 10
  headers by default. :gl:`#3670`

- Copy TLS identifier when setting up primaries for catalog member
  zones. :gl:`#3638`

- Fix an assertion failure in the statschannel caused by reading from the HTTP
  connection closed prematurely (connection error, shutdown). :gl:`#3693`

- The ``zone <name>/<class>: final reference detached`` log message was
  moved from the INFO log level to the DEBUG(1) log level to prevent the
  :iscman:`named-checkzone` tool from superfluously logging this message
  in non-debug mode. :gl:`#3707`

- The new name compression code in BIND 9.19.7 was not compressing
  names in zone transfers that should have been compressed, so zone
  transfers were larger than before. :gl:`#3706`

- When a catalog zone is removed from the configuration, in some
  cases a dangling pointer could cause a :iscman:`named` process
  crash. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3683`

- Fix a rare assertion failure in the outgoing TCP DNS connection handling.
  :gl:`#3178` :gl:`#3636`

/*
 * A qp-trie is a kind of key -> value map, supporting lookups that are
 * aware of the lexicographic order of keys.
 *
 * Keys are `dns_qpkey_t`, which is a string-like thing, usually created
 * from a DNS name. You can use both relative and absolute DNS names as
 * keys.
 *
 * Leaf values are a pair of a `void *` pointer and a `uint32_t`
 * (because that is what fits inside an internal qp-trie leaf node).
 *
 * The trie does not store keys; instead keys are derived from leaf values
 * by calling a method provided by the user.
 *
 * There are a few flavours of qp-trie.
 *
 * The basic `dns_qp_t` supports single-threaded read/write access.
 *
 * A `dns_qpmulti_t` is a wrapper that supports multithreaded access.
 * There can be many concurrent readers and a single writer. Writes are
 * transactional, and support multi-version concurrency.
 *
 * The concurrency strategy uses copy-on-write. When making changes during
 * a transaction, the caller must not modify leaf values in place, but
 * instead delete the old leaf from the trie and insert a replacement. Leaf
 * values have reference counts, which will indicate when the old leaf
 * value can be freed after it is no longer needed by readers using an old
 * version of the trie.
 *
 * For fast concurrent reads, call `dns_qpmulti_query()` to get a
 * `dns_qpread_t`. Readers can access a single version of the trie between
 * write commits. Most write activity is not blocked by readers, but reads
 * must finish before a write can commit (a read-write lock blocks
 * commits).
 *
 * For long-running reads that need a stable view of the trie, while still
 * allow commits to proceed, call `dns_qpmulti_snapshot()` to get a
 * `dns_qpsnap_t`. It briefly gets the write mutex while creating the
 * snapshot, which requires allocating a copy of some of the trie's
 * metadata. A snapshot is for relatively heavy long-running read-only
 * operations such as zone transfers.
 *
 * While snapshots exist, a qp-trie cannot reclaim memory: it does not
 * retain detailed information about which memory is used by which
 * snapshots, so it pessimistically retains all memory that might be
 * used by old versions of the trie.
 *
 * You can start one read-write transaction at a time using
 * `dns_qpmulti_write()` or `dns_qpmulti_update()`. Either way, you
 * get a `dns_qp_t` that can be modified like a single-threaded trie,
 * without affecting other read-only query or snapshot users of the
 * `dns_qpmulti_t`. Committing a transaction only blocks readers
 * briefly when flipping the active readonly `dns_qp_t` pointer.
 *
 * "Update" transactions are heavyweight. They allocate working memory to
 * hold modifications to the trie, and compact the trie before committing.
 * For extra space savings, a partially-used allocation chunk is shrunk to
 * the smallest size possible. Unlike "write" transactions, an "update"
 * transaction can be rolled back instead of committed. (Update
 * transactions are intended for things like authoritative zones, where it
 * is important to keep the per-trie memory overhead low because there can
 * be a very large number of them.)
 *
 * "Write" transactions are more lightweight: they skip the allocation and
 * compaction at the start and end of the transaction. (Write transactions
 * are intended for frequent small changes, as in the DNS cache.)

 *
 * A domain name can be up to 255 bytes. When converted to a key, each
 * character in the name corresponds to one byte in the key if it is a
 * common hostname character; otherwise unusual characters are escaped,
 * using two bytes in the key. So we allow keys to be up to 512 bytes.
 * (The actual max is (255 - 5) * 2 + 6 == 506)

 * These leaf methods allow the qp-trie code to call back to the code

 * methods are provided for a whole trie when the trie is created.
 *
 * The qp-trie is also given a context pointer that is passed to the
 * methods, so the methods know about the trie's context as well as a
 * particular leaf value.
 *
 * The `attach` and `detach` methods adjust reference counts on value
 * objects. They support copy-on-write and safe memory reclamation
 * needed for multi-version concurrency.
 *
 * Note: When a value object reference count is greater than one, the
 * object is in use by concurrent readers so it must not be modified. A
 * refcount equal to one does not indicate whether or not the object is
 * mutable: its refcount can be 1 while it is only in use by readers (and
 * must be left unchanged), or newly created by a writer (and therefore
 * mutable).
 *
 * The `makekey` method fills in a `dns_qpkey_t` corresponding to a
 * value object stored in the qp-trie. It returns the length of the
 * key. This method will typically call dns_qpkey_fromname() with a
 * name stored in the value object.
 *
 * For logging and tracing, the `triename` method copies a human-
 * readable identifier into `buf` which has max length `size`.
